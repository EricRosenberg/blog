Should you read this book? Yes.

This book was recommened to me by [Richard Slatter](https://twitter.com/richardslatter). It's not a life changing or particularly insightful book but its still worth the really quick read. I really enjoy leadership and self improvement books from the perspective of military leaders. It reminded me of L. David Marquet's [Turn The Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers-ebook/dp/B00AFPVP0Y).

After reading this book, I don't intend to start making my bed, but mostly because I get out of bed much earlier than Kari does. My personal equivalent is to start my day by putting away the dishes that dried overnight and then cleaning all of the dishes used to make breakfast. I've been doing this daily for a few months and like the book suggests, its motivating to start the day with a win and its comforting to know that when I get home from work I won't have to do any dishes.
