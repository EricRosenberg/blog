Should you read this book? No.

</br>
It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work reads like a 3.5 hour long advertising pitch for working at Basecamp. It does make Basecamp seem like a (mostly) nice place to work but the book isn't going to help you make your own organization less crazy. There's some interesting ideas here, but almost always paired with justification that felt flimsy or maybe applicable only to organizations the size of Basecamp. I didn't really gain anything by reading this.

My biggest gripe with the book is that it goes on and on about how real time chat applications are terrible for productivity without ever even acknowledging that Basecamp produces Campfire, a real time chat application. A ton of time is spent on painting Basecamp as a company so noble, moral, and ideals driven which made this omission feel a bit slimy and dishonest. Either they don't think real time chat is that bad, which makes their justification for their non-standard communication practices seem flimsy - or they do think real time chat is bad, and their whole moral high ground schtick feels fake.

I was also put off by Basecamp's silent and distraction free work environment. They describe their office environment as library like. They talk about how nobody even knows when their peers are online or working. They really emphasize the value of uninterupted focus over anything else. Focus is good but so is human connection. Distraction can be healthy. I know that I tend to be more of an agent of distraction at work than I should be, but this bit made Basecamp feel like a sad and lonely place to work.
