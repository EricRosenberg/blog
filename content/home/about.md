I am an engineering manager at Twitter. I work on the Android Foundation team.

Here are some unique things about me:

* I really love cheeseburgers. I maintain a list of my favorites.
* I think I can cook a steak better than most restaurants.
* I am highly motivated by forming habits and tracking my progress against them.
* I like to listen to electro swing music
* I like to read comic books
