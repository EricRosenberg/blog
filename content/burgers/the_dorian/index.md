The Dorian is a cool spot and it happens to be the closest burger to my home. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it. Overall, this is a burger that tries too hard to be fancy. Consider The Dorian for their giant whisky menu or their non-burger food (the deviled eggs were great) but don't come here for the burger. If you're looking for a burger in the neighborhood, go to Causwells instead.

This patty basically earned its points for being thick and medium rare. There's a lot of meat on this burger. It was a juicy patty but it lacked any distinct taste or texture.
<br/>
<br/>
The bun was both well seeded and well toasted. It held together well throughout the course of the meal.

The accoutrements were a mixed bag but were ultimately disappointing. Instead of traditional lettuce/pickle/onion/tomato this burger was topped with bacon-onion jam. I personally prefer a bit of fresh vegetable on my burgers. I didn't think the white cheddar added much flavor either. The bacon looked like the best part -  it was thick and crispy - but some parts tasted a bit burned. The "fancy sauce" was actually realy good but there was only a few drops and I wished there was more.
